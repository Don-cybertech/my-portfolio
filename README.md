## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🏠 Cybersecurity Home Lab
Designed and deployed a virtualized cybersecurity lab environment using VirtualBox and Kali Linux.

**Key Features:**
- Configured isolated virtual networks
- Deployed vulnerable machines (Metasploitable)
- Practiced scanning, enumeration, and exploitation techniques
- Conducted vulnerability assessments in a controlled lab
- 
  ### The Attacks Tested are as Follows:
I tested/discovered potential attack surfaces by:

Tools Used:
arp-scan
netdiscover
nmap -sn
Purpose:

After identifying the target IP, deeper enumeration was conducted to discover open ports and running services.
Commands Used:
nmap -sV --top-ports 1000 <TARGET_IP>
nmap -A <TARGET_IP>
nmap -sC -sV <TARGET_IP>

🔹 3. What Projects Should You Post?

Since you're in cybersecurity, here are strong project ideas:

## 🔐 1. Home Lab Documentation

## Setting-up cybersecurity-home-lab

## Step 1: Install VirtualBox

Go to https://www.virtualbox.org
Download the latest VirtualBox for your host OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Download and install the Extension Pack (same page, needed for better USB/network support).
Install both.

## Step 2: Download the Virtual Machine Images
We will use:

Kali Linux (attacker machine) — pre-built VirtualBox image (easiest)
Metasploitable 2 (intentionally vulnerable target) — classic, lots of vulnerabilities for scanning practice

Downloads:

Kali Linux VirtualBox image:
Go to https://www.kali.org/get-kali/
Scroll to “Virtual Machines” section
Download the VirtualBox image (usually a .7z or .ova file, ~3–4 GB)
Default credentials: kali/kali

Metasploitable 2:
Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/
Download metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip (~800 MB)
Extract the zip — inside you’ll find a folder with Metasploitable.vmdk (the virtual disk)
Default credentials: msfadmin/msfadmin


## Step 3: Import and Configure the VMs in VirtualBox
Import Kali:

Open VirtualBox → File → Import Appliance
Select the downloaded .ova file for Kali
Accept defaults or adjust RAM (allocate 2–4 GB) and CPU (2 cores)
Finish import

Create Metasploitable 2 VM:

In VirtualBox → New
Name: Metasploitable2
Type: Linux → Version: Ubuntu (64-bit)
RAM: 2 GB recommended
Hard disk: Use an existing virtual hard disk file → browse to the extracted Metasploitable.vmdk
Finish

Network Configuration (Important for isolation and communication):

In VirtualBox → File → Host Network Manager → Create a host-only network (e.g., vboxnet0). This isolates the lab from your real network.
For both VMs:
Settings → Network → Adapter 1
Enable Adapter
Attached to: Host-only Adapter
Name: select the one you created (vboxnet0)

## The Attacks Tested are as Follows:
I tested/discovered potential attack surfaces by:

## 1. Host discovery (finding live hosts in the lab network)
→ Using tools like arp-scan, netdiscover, and nmap -sn — this is reconnaissance, not an attack.
## 2. Port scanning and service enumeration
→ Commands like:
nmap -sV --top-ports 1000 <TARGET_IP>
nmap -A <TARGET_IP>
nmap -sC -sV <TARGET_IP>
→ This revealed open ports and running services/versions on Metasploitable 2, such as:
Port 21/tcp → vsftpd 2.3.4 (backdoor vulnerability, CVE-2011-2523)
Port 22/tcp → OpenSSH 4.7p1
Port 80/tcp → Apache httpd 2.2.8 (with DAV/2, multiple known issues)
Port 139/445/tcp → Samba smbd 3.X–4.X (e.g., username map script command execution, CVE-2007-2447)
And many others (e.g., Telnet on 23, UnrealIRCd on 6667 with backdoor, ProFTPD on 2121, etc.)
These scans identify exploitable services but do not exploit them — they simulate what an attacker would do in the reconnaissance phase.
## 3. Vulnerability scanning
→ Using Nessus Essentials (or Greenbone/OpenVAS alternative)
→ This produced a report highlighting known vulnerabilities with CVSS scores, such as:
Critical: vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor (CVSS 10.0) — allows unauthenticated root shell if triggered
High/Critical: Samba issues (e.g., potential remote code execution, symlink traversal)
High: Apache-related directory traversal, info disclosure
Others: Outdated software, weak configs, exposed services 

## Lessons to learn from this are:
Here are the key lessons we can draw from it:
1. Outdated Software Is One of the Biggest Attack Vectors

Metasploitable 2 runs ancient versions (e.g., vsftpd 2.3.4 from 2011, Samba 3.x, Apache 2.2.8, OpenSSH 4.7p1).
Lesson: Patch management is non-negotiable. Systems that aren't regularly updated become low-hanging fruit. In production, implement automated patching, version inventories, and end-of-life retirement policies.

2. Default / Weak Credentials Enable Rapid Compromise

The primary user is msfadmin:msfadmin (username = password).
Many services allow easy brute-force or credential stuffing.
Lesson: Enforce strong, unique passwords everywhere. Disable or rename default accounts. Use credential management tools, MFA where possible, and monitor for brute-force attempts (fail2ban, account lockouts).

3. Vulnerability Scanners Are Essential but Require Interpretation

Nessus flagged hundreds of issues (often 300–400+), with clear CVSS scores, exploitability info, and remediation steps.
Many were critical (CVSS 9–10), but some were noise (false positives or low-impact in context).
Lesson: Scanning alone isn't enough — prioritize findings (exploitability + business impact), validate manually when needed, and track remediation over time. Integrate scanners into continuous monitoring (e.g., feed into SIEM like Wazuh/Security Onion in a later project).

4. Reconnaissance Is the Foundation of Almost Every Attack

Simple Nmap scans (-sV -O -sC -A) revealed service versions, OS guess, and even some script-detected vulns.
Attackers rarely jump straight to exploitation — they start with footprinting just like we did.
Lesson: Blue teams must assume attackers are doing the same scans. Run your own periodic external/internal scans to see what an adversary sees. Harden against fingerprinting (e.g., obscure banners, disable unnecessary version info).

5. Isolation and Safe Practice Are Non-Negotiable

We used host-only networking in VirtualBox — zero risk to real networks.
Lesson: Never test on production, shared, or internet-facing systems without explicit permission. Use labs like this (or TryHackMe, HackTheBox) to build muscle memory safely.
